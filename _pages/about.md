<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a software engineer with expertise in embedded systems, network protocols, and artificial intelligence, as well as an AI Researcher specializing in Computer Vision, which consists of AI genenerative models, Scene Understanding, and AR/VR applications.
Previously, I am joining Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science at [Chonnam National University](https://global.jnu.ac.kr/jnumain_en.aspx), advised by [Prof. Hyung-Jeong Yang](https://rvlab.snu.ac.kr/people/jwlim). I completed my Bachelor‚Äôs degree at Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam.

I'm a royal fan of Chelsea Football Club and the music of Thomas Bergersen. I also wanna become an engineer, AI architect, scientist, programmer, troublemaker, manager, revisionist, salesman, entrepreneur, data analyst, product owner, debater, musician, comedian, biker, coffee addict, soju addict, ... a husband, and a father as well, probably forgot a few.
