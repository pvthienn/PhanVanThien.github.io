<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an AI researcher specializing in computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning, with a primary focus on developing generative AI models and avatar-based applications that push the boundaries of current technology. Additionally, I bring extensive experience as a skilled software engineer with expertise in embedded systems, network protocols, and industrial computer vision applications.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science at [Chonnam National University](https://global.jnu.ac.kr/jnumain_en.aspx), under the supervision of [Prof. Hyung-Jeong Yang](https://sclab.jnu.ac.kr/members). Previously, I completed my Bachelor‚Äôs degree at Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam.

I‚Äôm a devoted fan of K-Pop music and the game of carom billiards. I aspire to become an engineer, AI leader, scientist, programmer, creative thinker, manager, revisionist, salesman ‚Äî embracing many roles as a pioneer. Beyond my ambitions, I love exploring new flavors of coffee and soju and sharing great moments with friends.
